      “I don't give a shit what the world thinks. I was born a bitch, I was born a painter, I was born fucked.
      But I was happy in my way. You did not understand what I am. I am love. I am pleasure, I am essence,
      I am an idiot, I am an alcoholic, I am tenacious. I am; simply I am ... You are a shit.”
      <br />
      ― Frida Kahlo
